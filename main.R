# To do
# 1: produce one or more plots that demonstrate the relationship between the Landsat bands and the VCF tree cover


# 2: create an lm() model and show a summary (e.g. using summary()) of the model object you created. 
     #Which predictors (bands) are probably most important in predicting tree cover?


# 3: Plot the predicted tree cover raster and compare with the original VCF raster


# 4: Compute the RMSE between your predicted and the actual tree cover values 


# 5: are the differences between the predicted and actual tree cover the same for all of the 3 classes we used for the random forest classfication? 
#    Using the training polygons from the random forest classification, calculate the RMSE separately for each of the classes and compare. 
#    Hint - see ?zonal().
